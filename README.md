# Testing the Presidents of the United States

Your mission, should you choose to accept, is to write functional tests to ensure that acceptance criteria has been met for the three [attached user stories](UserStories.md). Below is the documentation for everything you need to complete the mission. This should take about an hour to do and no more than 2 hours total.


## Requirements

- **Fork this repository and commit your code to your fork when done.  This will help to identify the time taken to perform the test.**
- Read **ALL** of this README before starting!
- Each test needs to prove that the acceptance criteria for the related story is either met or not met.
- Each test should validate the associated UI and the API components.

## Usage

A [sample test](https://github.com/stevegood/potus-tests/blob/master/src/test/groovy/com/herokuapp/potus/PresidentsSpec.groovy#L13) has been created in the src/groovy directory. Run the tests by executing the gradlew binary.

Windows

    gradlew.bat -Penv=test chromeTest

Linux / Mac OS

    ./gradlew -Penv=test chromeTest

You will need to use a machine that can access the URLs in the notes section above.
